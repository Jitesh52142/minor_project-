    This app helps predict the safety risk in a location based on various factors such as:
    - Signal strength
    - Gender ratio (Male and Female count)
    - Crowd density
    - Time and date factors
    The prediction helps identify areas with potential safety concerns for women.

    ## Model Overview
    The model used in this application is a **Decision Tree Classifier**. It analyzes various input features such as:
    - Signal strength, crowd density, gender ratio, and time-based factors.
    The model classifies locations into high or low safety risk categories.

    ## Helpful Tips:
    - **Signal Strength**: Low signal strength may indicate a more dangerous area due to weak connectivity.
    - **Crowd Density**: Crowded areas can be more risky, depending on the time of day.
    - **Gender Ratio**: Significant imbalances in male-to-female ratio may indicate a potential risk.
